As a growth analyst at Mercado Libre, you are tasked with analyzing financial and user data to drive company growth. This assignment goal is to determine if predicting search traffic can aid in successful stock trading. The challenge involves four steps: identifying unusual patterns in hourly Google search traffic, analyzing the data for seasonality, relating search traffic to stock price patterns, and creating a time series model using Prophet.

I have learned from this assignment is that the analysis of search traffic data reveals key findings, including distinct time-based trends with peak traffic during daytime hours and lower activity on weekends. There is a weak correlation between search trends and stock market volatility or returns. Near-term forecasts predict an increase in MercadoLibre's popularity, indicating potential growth in search traffic.
